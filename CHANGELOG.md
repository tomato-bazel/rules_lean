# Changelog

All notable changes to rules_lean. The format is loosely
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) — version headers
mirror the published bazel-registry entries.

## 0.3.4 — `lean_emit.data` accepts external-repo files

- `lean_emit.data` now stages files at their workspace-relative path
  (e.g. `examples/regen_smoke/fixture.txt`) instead of the package-
  relative path the 0.3.3 release used. Externally-sourced data
  (`@some_repo//path:file`) is staged at `path/file` — the `..//<canon>`
  prefix in bazel's external-repo short_path is stripped. This lets
  consumers pull fixtures directly from upstream repos
  (e.g. `@postgres_src//:src/include/catalog/pg_namespace.dat`)
  instead of vendoring them.
- Smoke updated: `examples/regen_smoke/EchoFixture.lean` reads the
  full workspace-relative path.

## 0.3.3 — `lean_emit.data` attr

- `lean_emit` (and `lean_regen_test`) gain a `data` attr — non-Lean
  fixture files staged alongside `srcs` in the action's work directory
  without being compiled. The entry runs from that work dir, so it
  can `IO.FS.readFile` them by their package-relative path. Typical
  use: `.dat` / `.txt` / `.json` inputs the entry parses. Enabled
  rules_postgres' Lean-native `Pg.Catalog.Dat` round-trip gate
  against the vendored `pg_namespace.dat` sample.
- New smoke `examples/regen_smoke/regen_smoke_data` exercises the
  attr end-to-end: a Lean main reads `fixture.txt` and echoes it;
  the diff_test verifies the captured stdout matches the same
  `fixture.txt` (proving the data file is reachable from the Lean
  entry's relative-path `readFile`).

## 0.3.2 — `lean_regen_test` macro

- New `lean_regen_test(name, srcs, entry, expected, ...)` macro in
  `lean/lean.bzl`. Wraps `lean_emit` + skylib `diff_test` to assert a
  committed artifact matches the current Lean-emit output for a given
  Lean main. Captures the "Lean spec is source-of-truth; emitted X
  was generated from it" pattern that rules_postgres' Pg.Ir cluster
  Gate 1 was building on top of `lean_emit` + `diff_test` by hand.
- Smoke test under `examples/regen_smoke/` exercises the macro
  end-to-end against a tiny `Hello.lean` and a committed
  `expected.txt`.

## 0.3.1 — External-repo Lean sources

- `_module_path` and `_lean_test_impl` now handle external-repo
  source layouts (`../<repo>+/<package>/<file>` short_paths). Lets
  `lean_library` and `lean_test` targets in a consumer module
  reference Lean sources from a `bazel_dep` repo without copying
  the files into the consumer's tree. Used by rules_postgres'
  `lean/Pg/Ir/Emit/` modules when consumed through the registry
  rather than through a `local_path_override`.

## 0.3.0 — RulesLean Lean library + lake_imports_manifest

- Promote `v0.3.0-rc1` and pin to Lean `v4.30.0-rc2` for cslib compatibility.
- Add `RulesLean.Internal.Closure` (transitive olean closure computed from the
  Lake manifest) and `RulesLean.Internal.AxiomDeps` (`declaredAxioms` +
  `isAxiom`, Internal v0.1).
- CI: add a `ruleslean_library` matrix job so the in-tree Lean library is
  built + tested on every PR.
- Untrack `.vscode/` and notebook scratch artifacts; tighten `.gitignore`.

### 0.3.0-rc1 — RulesLean scaffold + manifest tooling

- Introduce the `RulesLean` Lean library under `lean/lib/` (Olean + Lake) and
  wire it through Bazel.
- Add the `lake_imports_manifest` target: workspace API,
  `exportedConstants` + `containsConstant`, and the `Internal` namespace
  convention with `namespacePackageIndex`.
- Add `tools/reservoir_manifest.py` — a stdlib-only Reservoir index fetcher.
- Update the install snippet to point at `fastverk/bazel-registry`.

## 0.2.2 — Un-dev bazel_skylib

- Promote `bazel_skylib` out of `dev_dependency` so downstream consumers can
  actually `load()` `lean/BUILD.bazel` without re-declaring it.

## 0.2.1 — README, license, CI, smoke test

- Bump module version to 0.2.1.
- Add `README.md`, MIT `LICENSE`, and the PR-gate CI workflow.
- Add a Batteries-only `lake_workspace` smoke test.
- Apply buildifier formatting fixes across the tree.

## 0.2.0 — Generalized Lake integration + stardoc

- Generalize the Lake integration so `lake_workspace` works for arbitrary
  Lake projects instead of being hard-coded to a single layout.
- Add stardoc generation for the public rules.

## 0.1.0 — Initial release

- First public cut of `rules_lean`: `lean_test`, `lean_emit`,
  `lean_prebuilt_library`, `lean_toolchain`, and the initial `lake_workspace`
  repository rule + `lake` module extension reusing Mathlib's Reservoir
  cache.
